# Benford PDF Tool

As a final for our Scalable Software Architechtures class, my team and I created a PDF NLP analyzer. This serverless project uses AWS tools like Lambda, S3, API Gateway, and RDS for cloud services. For NLP processes, we used AWS Comprehend on the text extracted from the PDF. The project allows the user to upload a PDF to S3, triggering the selected Lambda function to run. Once a process is complete, the results are stored in the S3 bucket and displayed to the user in the Python client. Due to unwanted costs, this AWS project and account have been deactivated.
